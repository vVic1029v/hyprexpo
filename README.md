## What is this?

HyprExpo is a maintained Hyprland plugin that lets you inspect workspaces, select
one with the pointer or keyboard, and move windows by dragging their previews.
It continues the original HyprExpo plugin with configurable grids, labels,
borders, multi-monitor placement, and Lua gestures.

- **Workspace grids:** square, rectangular, or dynamic layouts, with workspace
  names, configurable gaps, rounded tiles, and borders.
- **Keyboard and gestures:** focus navigation, workspace or visible-position
  selection, cancellation, and Lua-configured touchpad gestures.
- **Multi-monitor placement:** choose which workspaces appear on each monitor.
- **Native scrolling overview:** inspect individual windows, including offscreen
  windows, pan through the layout, and move windows within or between workspaces.
  Mixed-layout rows reuse workspace previews.

The [scrolling overview](docs/guides/scrolling-overview.md) supports pointer,
touch, and keyboard input. Its scope excludes hot corners, dwell activation,
layer-shell/wallpaper composition, and arbitrary workspace insertion.

## Quick Start

### 1. Check compatibility

`master` supports tagged Hyprland **v0.56.1 and v0.56.2**. The plugin must be
built against the **exact revision and dependency ABI** of your running
compositor; a binary built for one release is not interchangeable with another.

```bash
hyprctl version
```

For Hyprland-git, use the separate [development installation guide](docs/guides/development-installation.md).
For Nix-managed Hyprland, use the [Nix installation path](#nix).

<a id="install"></a>
<a id="hyprpm"></a>

### 2. Install with hyprpm

```bash
hyprpm add https://github.com/sandwichfarm/hyprexpo
hyprpm enable hyprexpo
hyprpm reload
```

The repository and plugin are both named `hyprexpo`; the build output is
`hyprexpo.so`. On supported releases, hyprpm uses the compatible commits listed
in [`hyprpm.toml`](hyprpm.toml). Changes on `master` do not automatically move
those pins.

### 3. Bind and open the overview

Add the binding for your active config format. In `hyprland.conf`:

```ini
bind = SUPER, g, hyprexpo:expo, toggle
```

Or in `hyprland.lua`:

```lua
hl.bind("SUPER + G", function()
    hl.plugin.hyprexpo.expo("toggle")
end)
```

Reload your configuration, then press **Super + G** to open the overview. Click a
workspace preview to select it; press **Escape** to cancel. For arrow-key or
Vim-style navigation, add the [keyboard submap bindings](docs/configuration/keyboard.md)
for your config format.

To confirm the plugin loaded and check for configuration errors:

```bash
hyprctl plugin list
hyprctl configerrors
```

See [troubleshooting](docs/troubleshooting.md) if loading or configuration fails.

## Quick Config

The defaults work without a plugin block. To customize the workspace grid, add
this to `hyprland.conf`:

```ini
plugin {
    hyprexpo {
        columns = 3
        rows = 0 # Follow columns for a square grid.
        gaps_in = 5
        gaps_out = 0
        bg_col = rgb(111111)
        workspace_method = center current
    }
}
```

For `hyprland.lua`, use `hl.config()` instead:

```lua
hl.config({
    plugin = {
        hyprexpo = {
            columns = 3,
            rows = 0, -- Follow columns for a square grid.
            gaps_in = 5,
            gaps_out = 0,
            bg_col = "rgb(111111)",
            workspace_method = "center current",
        },
    },
})
```

- **Ten fixed slots:** set `columns = 5`, `rows = 2`, `dynamic_grid = 0`, and
  `skip_empty = 0`. Empty workspaces remain selectable and accept dragged windows.
  Positive `rows` values are clamped to `1..7`; dynamic grids and native scrolling
  overviews ignore this option.
- **Click without moving windows:** set `drag_drop_enable = 0` to disable dragging
  workspace previews. Drag and drop is enabled by default.
- **Pinned/PiP previews:** `show_pinned_windows = 0` hides them from thumbnails
  by default, while leaving their normal Hyprland behavior unchanged.
- **Number keys:** `number_key_mode = workspace` selects global workspace IDs;
  `index` selects visible positions; `passthrough` leaves digits to your own binds.

### Active workspace grid

For a dynamic grid with workspace labels and a wallpaper background:

```ini
plugin {
    hyprexpo {
        dynamic_grid = 1
        fill_gaps = 0
        mru_sort = 0
        show_workspace_names = 1
        label_pos = top_right
        label_size = 48
        wallpaper_bg = 1
    }
}
```

In Lua, put these options inside the `plugin.hyprexpo` table passed to
`hl.config()` above. See [all configuration options](docs/configuration/options.md),
[labels and borders](docs/configuration/labels-borders.md), and
[Lua gestures](docs/guides/lua-gestures.md) for complete examples.

## Other Installation Methods

## Experimental: ribbon + app drawer (`exp/ribbon-drawer`)

This branch reworks the overview around a workspace ribbon and a pullable
app drawer (tracked on the public fork at
`https://github.com/vVic1029v/hyprexpo`, branch `exp/ribbon-drawer`):

```bash
git clone -b exp/ribbon-drawer https://github.com/vVic1029v/hyprexpo
cd hyprexpo
make dev-build
```

- **Workspace ribbon.** All provisioned workspaces in one pannable strip
  (16:10 tiles, `ribbon_scale`), auto-scrolled to the active workspace on
  open. Tiles are always the consecutive range 1 through the highest
  in-use workspace ID — no windows, no skipping, bottom-to-top. Pan with horizontal wheel / two-finger swipe, touchscreen swipe,
  or `hyprexpo:drawer`-style drags; touch rules are deterministic: sideways
  swipe always pans, only a still 350 ms hold picks a window up, anything
  else never grabs or selects by accident. Three-finger swipe up opens the
  overview and swipe down closes it (touchscreen and touchpad alike); both
  are idempotent — up never closes, down never opens.
- **Pullable app drawer.** Search strip plus app grid live on one sheet
  that follows the finger. A pull only commits past a quarter of the screen
  height, otherwise it springs back — opening and closing, mouse, touch,
  wheel, and touchpad alike. Closing pulls must start at the top of the
  list; pushes from deeper in only rubber-band (`drawer_resist`, default
  `0.25`). The overview background is transparent by default (`bg_col`
  alpha is honored); dimming and the opaque search well stay.
- **Locked order, recent row.** No pin system: the first row holds the most
  recently launched apps (recorded to `~/.config/hyprexpo/drawer-recent`),
  then a padded gap, then everything strictly alphabetical. Searching shows
  plain alphabetical matches. App names resolve against the session locale
  (no more mixed languages), entries with a missing `TryExec` binary are
  skipped, and tiles sliding under the search bar are culled instead of
  overlapping it.
- **Dispatchers.** `hyprexpo:drawer expand|collapse|toggle` animates the
  sheet through the same pull engine (never closes the overview itself);
  use `hyprexpo:expo` to open/close/toggle the overview.
- **On-screen keyboard.** Taps landing on a known keyboard layer surface
  (`plugin:hyprexpo:osk_namespaces`, default filled with `wvkbd`, plus
  first-detect auto-learn) fall through to the client instead of being
  swallowed, so an OSK works inside the overview. Virtual-keyboard keys
  flow into the drawer search box as usual.

## Next Steps

### Build From Source

Install a C++23 compiler, `pkg-config`, Hyprland development headers matching your
compositor, and these pkg-config packages:

```text
hyprland pixman-1 libdrm pangocairo libinput libudev wayland-server xkbcommon lua5.4
```

The build prefers `lua5.4` and falls back to `lua` on distributions that expose
the generic module name.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sandwichfarm/hyprexpo
cd hyprexpo
make all
```

Test local builds in a disposable nested session with `./scripts/run-nested.sh`.
Use `make dev-load` and `make dev-reload` from an existing disposable session.
See the [installation guide](docs/getting-started/installation.md) for Meson,
CMake, and managed installation commands, and follow the
[local installation contract](CONTRIBUTING.md#local-installation-contract).

Do not overwrite a loaded `.so` with `cp`: replacing its contents in place can
corrupt Hyprland's live memory mapping. Keep PR commits and temporary branches
out of a desktop's saved hyprpm revision; use the development load commands for
PR testing.

### Nix

Use the repository's [`flake.nix`](flake.nix) or [`default.nix`](default.nix)
through the Nix Hyprland plugin path. Keep the plugin and compositor on the same
Hyprland input; do not mix a hyprpm artifact into a Nix-managed session.

The flake defaults to Hyprland v0.56.2. Input overrides must select a revision
supported by the plugin source. See [Nix installation](docs/getting-started/installation.md#nix)
and the [aligned-input examples](docs/guides/development-installation.md#nix-consumer).

## Branches and Releases

| Track | Compatibility contract |
| --- | --- |
| `master` | Supported tagged Hyprland releases: v0.56.1 and v0.56.2. |
| `hyprland-git` | Explicitly tested upstream development commits; check its current pin before installing. |

Shared fixes flow from `master` into `hyprland-git`. Support for a new Hyprland
release returns through a validated promotion PR. See the
[branch and release policy](docs/reference/branch-policy.md) and
[compatibility and release provenance](docs/reference/compatibility.md).
